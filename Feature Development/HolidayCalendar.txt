Holiday Calendar

Admin Login

Create a new menu at the bottom on the left hand side bar "Holiday Calendar"

On this Holiday Calendar screen

Create a grid with columns:

Current Year: Hardcode the value to current Year

Date (DD-MMM-YYYY)
Holiday Description (Text)
Location (IND or US)

Give an "Add Holiday" button at the bottom which will dynamically add a row.
The row will have these 3 editable fields under each column:
Date - Date Picker
Holiday Description - Free Text
Location - Dropdown (IND or US)

There should be an Save and Cancel button at the end of this dynamic row

Clicking Save: Saves the row, the data appears part of the normal data grid and non editable. The Save and Cancel buttons are replaced by Delete button
Clicking Cancel: The data is not saved. Erased from temp memory. The dynamic row disappears.

The Holiday Grid with saved data is always visible.

Option to filter on every column header.

Enhance Apply Leaves logic:

Along with weekends, the Apply Leaves logic should start excluding Holidays, that match the user's location (IND or US), when calculating and displaying number of leaves applied.
