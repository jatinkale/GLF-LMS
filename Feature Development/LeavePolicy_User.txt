Leave Policy - General

Create these Leave types for all the employees in the Leave balances table and in other places as necessary: "Casual Leave", "Privilege Leave", "Paid Time Off", "Bereavement Leave", "Leave Without Pay", "Compensatory Off", "Maternity/Paternity Leave". Remove all other leave types from the system.
For every record that gets added to Employee Details there should be a record with leave balances. Default the leave balances to 0.

Create a menu in the left hand menu/sidebar - "Leave Policy" in the Admin

On the Leave Policy Screen:
Create 2 Sections by Region "India" and "US"

Section 1: India
- show 3 subsections in 3 rows split by Employment Type "Full Time Employee", "Full Time Direct Consultant", "Consultant"
- show leave categories and empty text boxes in front of each of the Employment Types: "Casual Leave", "Privilege Leave". Default value should be 0.
- show a dropdown with Month-Year in front of each of the Employment Type subsections after the leave types. Show a button that reads "Process Leaves" next to each Month-Year dropdown. The default value in the dropdown should be current month-year.

- User adds number of days (partial/decimal values are possible) inside each of the leave types for a specific Employment Type subsection.
- User selects a month and clicks "Process leaves" in front of it. Needs User confirmation to proceed.
- Use this logic after button is clicked: Filter all the "Active" = "Yes" employees. Filter all employees that have location = IND and Employment Type that matches the Employment Type for which the "Process Leaves" button is clicked.
- For all these filtered employees - add the values mentioned in the Casual Leave and Privilege leave for that specific employment type subsection to the existing leave balances
- Create a "Process History" button. Capture the specific values, which Month-Year and which Employment Type the data is processed and show it when this button is clicked.
- When processing for the same month-year for a second time, refer to this History to check and alert the user with a warning message before proceeding.

Section 2: US
