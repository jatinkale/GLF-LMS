2 methods to add an employee:

Method 1: Import through formatted excel sheet with headers in this order:

Email ID
Phone Number
Location
Designation
Department
Reporting Manager
Reporting Manager ID

Active


Add a button to the "Employee Details" page called "Import Excel"
Wire this button so that the system asks for a path to the excel and lets the user "Import"
Verify if the excel has correct format with first row as headers.
Employee ID, First Name, Last Name, Email ID, Reporting Manager, Reporting Manager ID, LMS Access, Active are mandatory. Verify that this data is present.
Verify that "LMS Access" has one of the 2 values "EMP" or "MGR"
Verify that "Active" has 2 values "Yes" or "No". Store this as Boolean in the db.
If the checks are successful do this:
1. If the Employee ID already exists in the records - update it with the data on the excel sheet
2. If the Employee ID does not already exist then create a new record with the details in the excel sheet
Capture the timestamp when the record was created and updated in 2 separate column in the db.
