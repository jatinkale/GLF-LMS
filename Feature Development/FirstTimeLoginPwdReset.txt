When a LMS user is created with default password and logs in for the first time:

1. Show a screen to reset the password
2. Screen should show: Current Password, New Password, Confirm New Password fields with Cancel and Submit buttons
3. Currently no restrictions on what new password is being set by the user
4. Store the new password and the user should then be able to log in using his new password
5. If an admin resets the password through Employee Management screen, then the following user login should again be treated like a first log in and should prompt him for password reset.
