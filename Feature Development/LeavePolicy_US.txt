Admin - Leave Policy - General

There is a menu in the left hand menu/sidebar - "Leave Policy"

On the Leave Policy Screen:
There are 2 Sections by Region "India" and "US"

In Section 2: US
1. Create all the subsections and functionality exactly same that for "India" subsection
2. Rename "Casual Leave" and "Privilege Leave" test boxes with "Planned Time Off" and "Bereavement Leave"

3. User adds number of days (partial/decimal values are possible) inside each of the leave types for a specific Employment Type subsection.
- User selects a month and clicks "Process leaves" in front of it. Needs User confirmation to proceed.
- Use this logic after button is clicked: Filter all the "Active" = "Yes" employees. Filter all employees that have location/region = US and Employment Type that matches the Employment Type for which the "Process Leaves" button is clicked.
- For all these filtered employees - add the values mentioned in the Planned Time Off (PTO) and Bereavement Leave (BL) for that specific employment type subsection to the existing leave balances (PTO and BL)
- Create a "Process History" button. Capture the specific values, which Month-Year and which Employment Type the data is processed and show it when this button is clicked.
- When processing for the same month-year for a second time, refer to this History to check and alert the user with a warning message before proceeding.
