Create LMS User using the Employee Details records

Maintain LMS user logins in a separate table.

Add a column to the employee details db that marks weather "LMS User Created" for every employee. Set it to No for everybody.

On the employee details grid: provide checkbox as the first column with a select all at the top.
Create a button at the top of the grid "Create/Update LMS Logins"

After a user selects one or more records and clicks the Create/Update button use the following logic:

1. The user logins should be created using the email ID
2. If the email ID as a login already exists - then only update the login record with the latest details: activate or deactivate the login based on the latest value AND update the access level to Employee or Manager based on the latest record.
3. If the email ID does not already have a login ID created - then add a new record with email ID as the Login ID and default password as "Password-123"
4. Update the LMS User Created flag in the employee details table to "Yes" in the db.
5. Always capture the timestamp when the record was created or updated.

Wire all the services and authentication such that the application will start accepting these users for logging in with appropriate access levels - Employee or Manager.

Start showing the LMS User Created - Yes/No on the Employee Details grid as well as on the "View Details" popup screen.
