"LMS User Management" Feature

Use the User Login table in the db or create new, do not mix LMS user mgmt details with employee details.

In the Actions column on the Employee Management screen grid, add 2 types of "Edit" icons

1. Existing "Edit Employee Details" icon/button
2. New "Edit LMS User" icon/button

On clicking this new button:
- Open a new modal popup "LMS User Management" with these details: User Name (non editable), Login ID (non editable), User Access (Emp or Mgr) (editable), User Enabled or disabled (only value, not editable)
- Give 3 buttons at the bottom: "Reset Password", "Disable User" (If the user is already enabled) OR "Enable User" (If the user is already disabled), "Delete User"
- "Reset Password" button should be in plain blue color shade
- "Disable User" button should be Orange, "Enable User" button should be Green. Plain colors no gradient. Button text white.
- "Delete User" button should be Red. Plain colours no gradient. Button text white.
- Create the button actions appropriately
- All the actions should ask for user confirmation
- Reset Password should reset the concerned user password to "Password-123"
- Deleting the user from LMS User Login should reset the LMS User created flag on the employee details screen to "No"
- Marking the user inactive on employee details should automatically "Disable" the LMS User login.
- "Enable User" on LMS User Mgmt should only enable when the user is "Active" on the Employee Details.
